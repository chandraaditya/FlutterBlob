# Flutter Blob

This is a project that I made for fun and to learn a bit more about Flutter Canvas. 

There are two types of blobs: static and animated.

The animated blob moves between two static blobs forever.

## Note

I am using a package called ```path_morph``` which is not null safe therefore to run you will need to add the following argument:

```--no-sound-null-safety```
